# About this handbook

## Who is it for?
This handbook is for anyone working as part of our service delivery teams.
Use it to check what methods you need to follow. You'll find guidance and templates that explain how to work consistently and effectively in your role.

## Why is this important?
Itâ€™s important that everyone understands our ways of working and their role in our teams. 
This includes how user centred design can best support service delivery and how we manage business change to support our regulatory services.
