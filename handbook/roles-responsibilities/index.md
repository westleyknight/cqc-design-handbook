# An introduction to CQC delivery teams 

> “It’s important that people who are involved in decision making are part of the team, so they’re accountable to the team - and the team as a whole can respond quickly to what they learn about users and their needs.”<br>_[Service Standard 6 - have a multidisciplinary team (gov.uk)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-6-have-a-multidisciplinary-team)_

## Service delivery teams

We deliver user centred design work as multidisciplinary teams.

Multidisciplinary teams are made up of people with a diverse mix of skills and expertise. This includes different design roles, technology and business change specialists, and project leadership.

Teams are trusted to make decisions together. They work with autonomy to make progress through discovery and alpha work.

## Service delivery ownership

A CQC __Service Director__ owns the vision for service areas assigned to them.

This means they agree priorities for our delivery teams to work on, in order that we achieve the desired policy and service outcomes.

A __Lead Subject Matter Expert (SME)__ is then part of each of our delivery teams. They are accountable to the Service Director and make day to day decisions as part of the work.

Other SME’s will also provide links into the wider business, and support for each of our multidisciplinary teams.
