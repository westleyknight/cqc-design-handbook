# Forming design teams 

Itâ€™s important that the size of each team in the design phase of work reflects the size and complexity of the feature, part of a service, or whole service it has been asked to focus on.

In a smaller team, and through considering the size and scope of the work, a single designer or research role may be used, rather than using multiple specialists.

## Example: 2-week rapid design sprint

Importantly, the core team here has the skills to plan and conduct user research, design and test prototypes and to conduct business analysis. 

Further skills, including technology consultancy and a performance analyst, are available from resources based outside the core team (roles shared across a larger programme of work).

### Core Team
- Lead SME
- Delivery and project lead
- Designer or researcher
- Business analyst

### Extended team
- Service Director
- Technology consultant
- Performance analyst
- Other SMEs (e.g. operations, legal, policy)

## Example: 8 to 12 week agile sprint model
In a larger team, we would consider including different design specialists depending on the scope and size of the work.

### Core team
- Lead SME
- Delivery and project lead
- Service designer
- User researcher
- Interaction designer
- Business analyst
- Content designer
- Technology consultant

### Extended team
- Service director
- Performance analyst
- Other SMEs (e.g. operations, legal, policy)
