# Assumptions and hypotheses
### Type of work and output
Discovery
### Why it’s important
The goal of all user centred design work should be to manage risk through user research and engagement, increasing our confidence in solutions and business change being prioritised.

From the start of projects, teams need to be clear about any assumptions that need to be further understood or tested.

This enables us to to challenge internal knowledge and perspectives about how to best meet user needs in order to deliver policy outcomes successfully. 


## Capturing assumptions to test
An assumption is either something that we believe is true, or can be something that we’re expecting to happen.

A simple format for capturing assumptions as a team:
```
We think that [this] is true 
OR We think that [this] will happen

Which is why we think [this] is happening 
OR Which we think creates [this] opportunity

We can learn more about this assumption by speaking to [these] users in [these] scenarios
OR by looking at [this] data
```

Any assumptions we capture and prioritise will be based on what we think we know as a business. These will also be shaped by our personal experiences and individual viewpoints as people working in CQC. 

A ‘hypothesis’ is simply a testable assumption - including how we can learn more about a assumption through user research and data analysis.

## Running a workshop
1. Capturing team assumptions 
2. Convert assumptions to hypotheses 
3. Prioritise assumptions and hypothesis by evidence and importance

## Who to involve in this activity
Capturing assumptions should involve the core project team and involve other stakeholders as needed to bring perspective from the wider business.

## Responsibilities during this activity

### Delivery and project lead
- Ensures that kick of workshops and problem framing work leads to prioritised assumptions to test through the planning and delivery of user research.

### Service designer 
- Responsible for framing and capturing assumptions, ensuring a user-centred approach on the problem to solve.

### User researcher
- Takes part in workshops and discussions to understand and capture assumptions.
- Responsible for taking prioritised assumptions into user research planning.

### Business analyst
- Takes part in workshops and discussions to understand and capture assumptions.
- Responsible for bringing business insights and data, as well as analysis of data, to support or challenge assumptions through team conversation and prioritisation of riskiest assumptions to focus on. 

### Interaction designer
- Takes part in workshops and discussions to understand and capture assumptions.
- Looks specifically for any assumptions around types of interactions and channels to deliver a service and policy outcome.

### Content designer
- Takes part in workshops and discussions to understand and capture assumptions.
- Looks specifically for any assumptions around types of content and how information needs to be shared or communicated to deliver a service and policy outcome.

### Technology consultant
- Takes part in workshops and discussions to understand and capture assumptions.
- Advises specifically on technology constraints, and investigates any assumptions or unknowns around technical constraints to consider. 

### Performance analyst
- Responsible for feeding existing data and insights knowledge into the prioritisation of assumptions and hypotheses
- Validates that existing service data and insights are accurate through testing hypotheses.
- Responsible for highlighting and sharing gaps in data and insights.
