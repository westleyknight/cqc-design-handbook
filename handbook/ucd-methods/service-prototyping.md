# Service prototyping

### Type of work and output
Discovery and alpha

### Why it’s important
Service prototyping is a way to simulate and test the interactions of a service experience. It can involve ‘roleplay’, or be more detailed, full-scale recreations of a service with service users, props and physical touchpoints.

Testing of business changes internally should follow early staff engagement and learning, and is a chance to model changes and evaluate ways of working and roles. 

## Step by step process 
1. Agree the parts of a service you need test, who you need to test with, and what scenarios this needs to cover.
2. Plan your prototyping activities. This might require operational planning, process maps and service models to test with an internal team. Or it might require setting up parts of a service, including product prototypes, to test with external user groups. 
3. Create a research plan and manage recruitment of who you need to test with. If this involves internal users, it will require coordination with managers to agree access to staff time and availability.
4. Deliver your service prototyping through simulation of scenarios, testing and evaluation. You might decide to make changes as you test, and learn about how teams adapt and respond to new processes and models of service delivery. 
5. Feed all learnings and analysis from back to your team. This should inform priorities for further design iterations of solutions and the need for further testing. 
6. Document everything you test and share learning.

## Choosing prototype fidelity
Prototypes can come in different forms, stages of refinement and levels of detail. 

### Low fidelity examples
- Desktop walkthroughs to explore essential steps in the journey
- Cardboard prototypes to get first ideas about the shape of the future service
- Sketches on paper to visualise early stages of different types of interface and interactions.

### High fidelity examples
- Contextual simulations 
- Pilots, to test technical and feasibility aspects
- Immersive models to evaluate the detailed look and feel of how a service is intended to work, including online and offline interactions.

## Who to involve in  this activity
Service prototyping should be led by the service design specialist, with input and support from the whole team.

There needs to be a shared understanding of what is being tested and why.

## Responsibilities during this activity

### Delivery and project lead
- Prioritises prototyping and learning activities as part of sprint planning and focus at alpha stages of work. 

### Service designer 
- Responsible for planning and leading service prototyping work. 
- Ensures that learnings are documented, shared and shape team priorities and decision making

### User researcher
- Supports the service designer on running and evaluating service prototyping work.
- Ensures that learnings are documented, shared and shaping team priorities and decision making

### Business analyst
- Responsible for creating detailed business, collusion and process documentation. And updating requirements and process change. 
- Ensures business change is feasible, assessing the impact of proposed changes on staff roles and ways of working
- Responsible for documenting detailed requirements including user stories.

### Interaction designer
- Supports the service designer on running and evaluating service prototyping work.

### Content designer
- Responsible for the design of content as part of service interactions, and testing how information is shared or communicated with teams and different user types.

### Technology consultant
- Supports service prototyping, advising on technical constraints and how technology solutions and constraints can best support changes to business processes and ways of working.

### Performance analyst
- Builds awareness and understanding of the end to end service’s touchpoints, in order to plan and devise measurement of the service performance against policy intent.
