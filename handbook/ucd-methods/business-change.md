# Exploring business change
### Type of work and output
Discovery
### Why itâ€™s important
Exploring business change is an important part of how we engage early and regularly with stakeholders and our CQC internal teams.

## Step by step process 
1. Agree and conceptualise the type of business change you want to learn about with CQC internal teams. This might include starting by learning about current process and ways of working.
2. Create a research plan around any service concepts you want to explore. A high level experience or user journey map can act as an effective prompt to talk with colleagues and get feedback about any proposed changes to ways of working and future business processes. 
3. Think about how best to use research internally. Options include 1 to 1 interviews, which might include team leaders and senior management, as well as frontline colleagues.
4. Consider running and facilitating workshops with larger groups of colleagues. Workshops are the opportunity to ask the wider business to contribute to design artefacts and help develop concepts and ideas with their direct input. 
5. Feed learnings and analysis from engagement with business teams back to your project teams priorities. This should inform  future design work and decisions moving into alpha.

## Making service decisions through business engagement
1. Map out end to end processes and tasks involved in running a service. Highlight pain points or opportunity areas within the business to increase impact and value.
2. Use any visual artifacts to support concept testing with key staff groups and teams. Or, to make a case to test viability and feasibility of business change with senior leaders.
