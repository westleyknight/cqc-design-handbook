# Service blueprinting

### Type of work and output
Alpha

### Why it’s important
A service blueprint shows the relationships between different service components. This sets out the design or high level plan for a whole service, or part of a service. It shows the intended user experience and journeys within the service.

A good blueprint will visualise components in enough detail so the wider organisation can analyse the underlying business model and requirements for a service proposition, as well as revealing dependencies and helping to monitor performance across different user touchpoints.

## Creating and maintaining a service blueprint
Service blueprints can look different and vary in how they are visualised.

They capture the detailed interactions and processes that will have an impact on the user’s experience, goals and service efficiencies. They also represent a high level view of organisational design – mapping the people and processes needed to deliver different parts of services, as well as showing who, or which teams, own what parts of a journey. 

CQC teams will link to a blueprint from other technical documents being produced. This includes process maps, user stories and specifications.

1. Think about how to best visualise steps and tasks involving different users of the service. This might mean you join up journey flows which link, overlap to see where the experience breaks. 
2. Make sure your blueprint clearly shows an overall service vision, and aligns with policy outcomes. 
3. Capture enough detail around processes for everyone in the team to understand how a future service is intended to work and operate. 

## How to use service blueprints:
1. Expand existing service maps and artifacts produced in discovery and alpha  by integrating supporting technology, data and user interactions in each phase of the journey
2. Prioritise and focus on key issues for development of new features and sub services, reviewing the whole service or key pain points a user is experiencing. 
3. Visualise interactions between the different users of the service at all levels. (front stage and backstage, supporting processes.)
4. Define and include service KPI’s in terms of quality and time for the interactions/touchpoints. 

# Components of a service blueprint

## Custom perspectives / lines / lanes
Further lines and lanes can be added to visualise the project specific content.

For example: 
- Time it takes to complete
- Empathy/feelings and pains experienced
- User needs
- Insights 
- Technical systems
- Application rules
- Regulation 
- Policy / rules
- Explicit lines of external interactions with partners or organisations
- Ideas and opportunity
- Who’s responsible for this part. (In public sector the department structures mis-align with how services need to be built)

## Who to involve in  this activity
Service blueprinting should be led by the service designer in collaboration with the rest of the team. 

The business analyst and technology consultant create supporting business artefacts and requirements from this wor. For example, detailed process maps, diagrams and user stories.

## Responsibilities during this activity

### Delivery and project lead
- Prioritises work in the team to work towards a final service blueprint at the end of alpha work.
- Ensures that related business and technical artefacts have been created, supporting the business analyst.

### Service designer 
- Responsible for leading service blueprint design, including taking onboard feedback and changes from the team and wider stakeholders in the business.

### User researcher
- Responsible for feeding insights and evidence from research to shape the final service blueprint.
- Responsible for testing any remaining assumptions or unknowns identified in future user journeys and experiences being designed. 

### Business analyst
- Supports blueprint work, working closely with the service designer, while producing related business artefacts.
- Responsible for creating process diagrams, and detailed descriptions of business functions to feed requirements.
- Responsible for creating user stories for both business change and technical build. 

### Interaction designer
- Responsible for ensuring that digital prototypes and concepts that the team are testing and iterating, join up fully with the service blueprint. 
- Ensures that the blueprint captures all user interactions correctly. 

### Content designer
- Ensures that the blueprint captures content types and interactions correctly. 

### Technology consultant
- Advises on technical considerations and constraints around the final blueprint design.
- Shapes business artefacts, feeding into work with the Business Analyst.

### Performance analyst
- Builds awareness and understanding of the end to end service’s touchpoints, in order to plan and devise measurement of the service performance against policy intent.
- Ensures that the blueprint captures data tracking correctly.
