# Product prototyping

### Type of work and output
Alpha

### Why it’s important
Product prototyping enables team to rapidly learn about how ideas and solutions work, testing and iterating regularly based on user feedback.

Product prototyping focuses on the design and testing of user interactions, task flows and detailed interface design.

Teams should use the quickest, cheapest way of creating prototypes. This can be paper-based, use wireframing software, or be built rapidly using HTML code and front end toolkits.


## Step by step process 
1. Agree what your prototype needs to test, who you need to test with, and what scenarios this needs to cover. Begin planning and recruiting participants for user research.
2. Create your prototype. Consider whether you need something high-fidelity to test detailed content and user interface (UI) design. Or whether you can learn more quickly about user flows and concepts from low-fidelity paper prototypes.
3. Test your prototype and analyse the findings as a team.
4. Feed learnings and analysis from your prototype testing back to your team. This should inform priorities for further design iterations to solutions and the need for further testing. 
5. Document all prototyping work and what you test into your teams design decision log. 
6. Document any updates to design patterns, and insights into CQC’s design systems and research library.


## Consider accessibility
It’s important to think about testing for accessibility and usability from the start of your design process.

## Who to involve in this activity
Product prototyping should be led by design specialists, with input from the whole team.
There needs to be a shared understanding of what is being tested and why.

## Responsibilities during this activity

### Delivery and project lead
- Manages the backlog of work to design, test and iterate user journeys and service designs.

### Service designer 
- Responsible for ensuring prototypes fit into a whole service blueprint and user journeys. 
- Supports user research, testing and analysis work.

### User researcher
- Responsible for planning the testing of prototypes with representative user groups, including recruitment. 
- Responsible for leading analysis of research work feeding into further prioritised work.

### Business analyst
- Responsible for creating detailed documentation or specifications in response to prototypes and testing evaluation.
- Ensure that solutions can be built. Including the creation of functional and non-functional requirements - such as process diagram maps.
- Responsible for documenting and prioritising detailed requirements including user stories.

### Interaction designer
- Responsible for creating working prototypes, that include the detail of how something will work, in order to test and improve solutions with user feedback. 
- Responsible for capturing assumptions and leading work to prioritise changes to how something could work by defining testable hypotheses.

### Content designer
- Responsible for the design of content as part of product interactions to test and iterate with user feedback. 

### Technology consultant
- Supports product prototyping, advising on technical constraints and considerations for the new solutions. 

### Performance analyst
- Firm up their understanding of what we need to track and why.
- Creates an upfront plan of what success means for the product.
- Creates the live infrastructure to be able to test and learn.
