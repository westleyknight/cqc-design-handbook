# Problem framing
### Type of work and output
Discovery
### Why it’s important
Problem framing is how we reach shared understanding as a team around the work we’re doing, and where we need to start from. 

Everyone will see problems to solve from their own perspective, based on the expertise they bring. Problem framing aligns an entire team in the same direction.

This includes how teams understand existing work, artifacts, data or research in a service area.

## Frame the problem
Start with this simple framework of 5 questions to frame the problem when starting user centred design phase activities. 
### 1. Why are we prioritising this work? 
How does it support CQC’s purpose and strategy? What are the service outcomes, and what is the service vision to work towards?
### 2. What are the user problems we need to solve?
How can we design effective, efficient regulation through how services will meet different types of user needs?
### 3. What research have we done?
What do we know already? Where are our biggest gaps (including any risky assumptions that need to be tested or challenged)?
### 4. What design artefacts and outputs have we produced?
How will this help us? Where is the best place to start?
### 5. What dependencies exist here?
What other services and policy areas do we need to consider?

## Running a workshop
1. Have a group facilitator and involve everyone in your team. 
2. Take one question at a time. Ask the group to write one thing per post it note. Allow time for everyone to think.
3. Affinity sort and group themes. Then discuss and explore what you’ve captured.
