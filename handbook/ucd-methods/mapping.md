# Mapping
### Type of work and output
Discovery and alpha
### Why it’s important
We use service maps to make sense of the problem space we’re working in.

Mapping helps you and your team to:
- capture existing user experiences and journeys - ‘as is’ mapping
- explore future scenarios, thinking about how user experiences and journeys could work - ‘to be’ mapping
- build a shared understanding of how services work internally and externally, including user pain points

## Types of service mapping
It’s important to think about the type of map you need to make. Examples of each type of maps and descriptions are on the next slide.

### Storyboard
A visual way of telling a story. You draw what is happening in every scene to describe a sequence of events.

Hand drawings or simple pictures are an effective way to illustrate a story or user journey in this way. These can be captured as a team activity.

### User experience map
A way of understanding what people are thinking, feeling and doing when completing a task or working towards a goal.

An experience map captures both the high and low points of an experience people have across different stages of a service. This will usually include how people anticipate doing something (what happens beforehand), and how they reflect on the experience (what happens afterwards).

This is a great way of capturing and mapping research insights to develop an understanding of opportunities to improve the user experience.

### User journey map
A way of understanding the component parts and interactions across a service, or part of a service journey. This will either show how something works at the moment - ‘as is’ - or, it will show how we intend something to work in the future - ‘to be’.

Journey maps can start as low fidelity team activities to understand and map journeys. Before being turned into more detailed, design artefacts.

Used effectively, journey maps should be living artefacts. They are a focal point for team conversations, enabling decisions to be made based on user needs and service context..

### User story map
An approach used in agile software and product delivery. 

Story mapping is a great way of building a shared understanding of what you’re building and why. This approach is a way of breaking down the product or software components of a project. This way teams can prioritise what to build, but it’s not a full view of an end to end service with internal and supporting processes.

## Who to involve in  this activity
Mapping activities can involve the core project team and wider stakeholders. 

Think about how to produce draft artefacts using workshops before they are designed into more detailed outputs to support design decisions and specifications. 

## Responsibilities during this activity

### Delivery and project lead
- Prioritises mapping activities as part of sprint planning and focus at discovery and alpha stages of work. 
- Helps organise workshop space and time for the team to focus on this activity.

### Service designer 
- Responsible for mapping activities in the team, including planning and facilitating workshop time online or in person.
- Responsible for design hi-fidelity outputs from maps, taking post-it notes and rough concepts through to more detailed artefacts. 

### User researcher
- Supports mapping activities, ensuring that insight from research feeds into mapping of both existing, and proposed future user experiences or journeys. 

### Business analyst
- Ensures the team are working with an appropriate understanding of business rules and constraints.
- Supports mapping activities, while producing related business artefacts.
- Responsible for creating process diagram maps and detailed descriptions of required business functions.
- Responsible for creating user stories for business change and technical build. 

### Interaction designer
- Supports mapping activities focusing specifically on types of interaction throughout different user journeys. 
- Responsible for ensuring prototypes and concepts are aligned with mapping work and any new concepts being developed.

### Content designer
- Supports mapping activities focusing specifically on types of content and information being used, and understood, throughout different user journeys.

### Technology consultant
- Takes part in mapping activities.
- Advises on technical considerations and constraints around the design of future user experiences and journeys.

### Performance analyst
- Supports mapping activities, focusing specifically on feeding data touch points into mapping, and highlighting behavioural metrics and insights.
