# User centred design methods

We apply the following core methods and approaches during our user centred design phases of work.

This section explains our methodology in more detail. This includes a breakdown of what is expected from individual roles in our teams when delivering these activities.

We have also included links to templates, and more in-depth guidance and reading.

## Discovery activities and outputs

- __Problem framing__ to focus on service outcomes and alignment to service vision
- __Assumptions and hypotheses__ to test, building confidence in the solutions we will prioritise
- __User research__ with providers, CQC internal teams and citizens who use our services 
- __Mapping user journeys and experiences__, including the existing solutions, and exploration of how services could work in the future
- __Exploring business change__, including early engagement and feedback from staff and stakeholders

## Alpha activities and outputs
- __Product prototyping__ using code and front end toolkits, where possible â€“ iterated with user and stakeholder feedback
- __Service prototyping__ for testing changes within whole services, including role play and engaging with staff in the business to test parts of proposed business change
- __Service blueprinting__ to capture final details of service solutions, linked to business implementation requirements and dependencies
