# User research
### Type of work and output
Discovery and alpha
### Why it’s important
User research is the process of learning through direct engagement with our users - both internal and external.

In discovery, we use research to better understand who our users are, what they need to do, and how they behave in different types of situation. This is so we know we’re solving the right problem when delivering policy outcomes.

In alpha, we do research to test and iterate our ideas. This makes sure that what we are designing will meet user needs, helping us to iterate solutions using real user feedback.

## User research is a team sport
Each member of the team can take part in user research activities.
### Planning 
- Make sure you have an dedicated user researcher lead activities. Everyone in the team can then feed into research plans.
- Organise and run team workshops to co-create approaches together.
### Delivering research
- Give everyone in the team the opportunity to view research sessions first hand - seeing how users interact with services helps to build empathy.
- With permission, record research sessions. This way playbacks can be organised in your team and with wider stakeholders.
### Analysis
- Invite everyone in your team to be part of research analysis, or challenge and support sessions to look at research outputs and recommendations.
- Work together as a team to agree actions from research, identifying further gaps in knowledge, and prioritising all design decisions based on evidence and learning.
- Ensure that the team stores research findings so that everyone can access them. This will also enable you to share research outside of the team.
