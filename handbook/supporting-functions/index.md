# Supporting functions

## Research ops
Research ops optimises the people, processes and methodologies behind our user research activities. It ensures knowledge sharing and consistency across all programmes at CQC - and that time and resources are used efficiently.

It oversees the governance, knowledge management, tools management and participant recruitment required for user research.

## User research library
A catalogue of previous and ongoing research activities across CQC programmes. 
This helps teams to work with learnings from previous work, helping them to build knowledge, empathy and understanding. 

It also helps teams to focus on the unique and risky aspects of their service.

A user research library is a live catalogue. It should be updated as user needs evolve, or dissolve. 

## Design systems
A catalogue of styles, components and design patterns, with supporting guidance and research evidence. The design system should be the starting point for all teams when designing their service.

You learn from the research and experience of other service teams and avoid repeating work that’s already been done. This frees up your time to focus on the unique problems in your service. It also makes our services consistent, so they’re easier to use.

As teams design solutions through their service delivery work, they record new components and patterns in the design system.

It’s important to have a strong community behind a design system. It brings together the latest research, design and development from across CQC, to make sure it’s relevant and representative of it’s different users.

## Service definition and business architecture
The context that our service delivery work sits within. CQC services sit within a wider ecosystem of many moving parts.

The service definition and business architecture defines how our work complements, responds to and feeds into these other moving parts:
- strategy
- capability
- processes 
- organisation
- data
- systems
- infrastructure
