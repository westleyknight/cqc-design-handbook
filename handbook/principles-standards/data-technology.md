# Make the service smarter using data and technology

## Use data and technology to create effective, efficient and more adaptable solutions. Donâ€™t push complexity onto users.

Take the time to understand what you are trying to solve, 
and how to make people's journeys easier and more effective.

Technology decisions are a significant investment. 
The choices your team makes have a huge impact on how sustainable and efficient the service can be.

### Why this matters

The wrong technology decisions can mean users need to make more interactions to get the same result. Or read more content to understand an un-intuitive journey.

We want to remove unnecessary interactions and content. We know this can lead to big improvements for the external and internal user experience.

We should advocate for in-context support tailored to what the user is trying to achieve. If we can remove the burden on a user and automate - we should. But only of the user has full control of all decisions being made. 

Giving timely support, confirmation and updates should be ingrained into the whole experience proposition. 

### Good practice
You should:
- use tech to make efficient and cost effective services
- make evidence-based technology decisions - and document them
- consider future needs when making decisions today
- plan and test legacy integrations, in advance
