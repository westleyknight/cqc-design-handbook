# Understand strategic outcomes and policy 

## Understand how the service fits within CQC’s strategy. Use an intelligent, risk-based approach to regulation.

Show that you have taken the time to ensure all user centred design work is connected to CQC’s strategy, strategic service outcomes and policy intent.

Throughout discovery and alpha work, teams should be able to show how they’ve understood and applied CQC strategy to deliver smarter regulation. Doing this helps your solution deliver the right policy outcomes.

### Why this matters
Your service delivery team is working within policy and operational rules. These are vital to CQC delivering regulatory services.

You need to know who to include in decision making for the design of your service.

Consider if you need to include:
- operations
- legal
- security
- communications
- change and delivery
- commercials
- analytical
- senior leaders

### Good practice
You should:
- include policy and operational colleagues in your team’s work
- make your work and decisions visible to the wider organisation, to help build trust with stakeholders - show and tells and weeknotes are a good place to start
- understand the policy intent or regulation behind the service
