# Test the service early and often with real people

## Design and test your work. Observe real behaviours and scenarios to challenge your assumptions.

Start small. Experiment with different ways of solving problems. Use prototypes to improve your understanding and test ideas at least every 2 weeks. Do this in every phase of design work.

Never build a solution that hasn’t been tested. Flag these as risks.

Prioritise what you’ll test as a team. This helps you focus on work that will deliver the most learning and insight.

### Why this matters

Our services must work for the people who need to use them. The only way to ensure this is to test our ideas and designs with real users.

Testing shows us where content and process is difficult to understand - or missing altogether. It also shows us where an interaction isn’t intuitive or what users are expecting.

It’s okay if testing shows that our ideas don’t work. We should not be afraid to get things wrong. Knowing what doesn’t work helps us find what does.

### Good practice
You should:
- test multiple solutions to find which works best
- test your processes as well as your products
- test how new features affect the whole journey
- act on analytics and support data
