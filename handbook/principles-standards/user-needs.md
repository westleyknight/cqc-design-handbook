# Focus on user needs

## Understand the people who use the service. Know their needs, behaviours, pain points and motivations.

Take time to learn about the people who use CQC services. Learn about the whole person and the context of their interactions with CQC. This includes their emotional, physical and technical needs.

We need to understand CQC internal teams too. They spend time helping us inspect and regulate providers. It’s important we understand their processes to make their work as efficient and effective as possible.  

### Why this matters
A focus on users needs means we solve the right problems, and build services that will work effectively.

### Who uses our services

#### Providers
The people and organisations that deliver care.

#### Citizens 
The people who benefit from the care providers deliver.

#### CQC internal teams
The people that make our services work and who work with service data. This includes Data and Insight Analysts, National Customer Service Center staff and inspectors. 


### Good practice
You should:
- understand how and why a user needs to do something
- use user research to generate insights and build empathy
- prioritise users’ needs when designing and testing solutions
- work as a team to spot knowledge gaps and identify excluded user groups
