# User centred design principles and standards

## These principles are our standards for good design. We use them to guide our work and decision making.

This deck explains why each principle matters, and how you can meet it.

We assess our services against these principles. So it's important you and your team follow them. The tools and techniques in our design manual will help you do this.

### 1. Understand strategic outcomes and policy
Understand how the service fits within CQC’s strategy. Use an intelligent, risk-based approach to regulation.

### 2. Focus on user needs 
Understand the people who use the service. Know their needs, behaviours, pain points and motivations.

### 3. Design for a whole service
Make design decisions in a joined up, consistent way, 
from start to finish. 

### 4. Make sure everyone can use the service
Design for inclusion, fair outcomes and accessibility - from the start.

### 5. Make the service smarter using data and technology
Use data and technology to create effective, efficient and more adaptable solutions. Don’t push complexity onto users.

### 6. Test the service early and often with real people
Design and test your work. Observe real behaviours and scenarios to challenge your assumptions. 

### 7. Work collaboratively and with the wider business 
Work in blended teams to develop skills and design capabilities. Bring SMEs together to support and inform delivery choices.

### 8. Build on existing services and evidence
Reuse what already works and has been tested with users. Share your team’s work, documenting evidence and design patterns.
