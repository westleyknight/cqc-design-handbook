# Work collaboratively and with the wider business

## Work in blended teams to develop skills and design capabilities. Bring subject matter experts (SMEs) together to support and inform delivery choices.

Work as one joined up team. Activities like user research, ideation and backlog refinement can be supported by specialists but carried out together. This helps develop skills and ensure decisions work for every aspect of the service.

Extend team activities to stakeholders. Find every opportunity to collaborate with SMEs and the wider business.

### Why this matters

Itâ€™s important that CQC develops digital skills throughout the delivery of user centred design work. This means transferring knowledge and experience in house wherever possible.

Working in blended teams of different suppliers and CCQ internal teams is an opportunity for everyone to take part in the delivery of design and research together.

### Good practice
You should:
- use agile ways of working and ceremonies to organise collaborative work as a team
- treat user research as a team sport, with everyone observing research first-hand and able to take part in analysis sessions
- invite stakeholders to user research playback sessions and regular show and tells
