# Make sure everyone can use the service

## Design for inclusion, equitable outcomes and accessibility - from the start.

CQC services must work for everyone who needs to be regulated. This means our services must work for people with different physical, mental health, social, cultural or learning needs. 

> “A service must be usable by everyone who needs to use it, regardless of their circumstances or abilities.”<br>_The School of Good Services_

### Why this matters

Designing for accessibility is how we ensure services work for the people that need to use them. It is also law. We are breaking the law if we design services that are not accessible.

Inclusion is about more that accessibility. It’s making sure anyone who needs to use the service is supported and able to carry out the tasks required. This applies to both our external and internal users.

### Good practice
You should:
- design for everyone from the start - remember those that find it more difficult to use technology
- test your ideas and solutions with users with diverse needs
- audit your service for accessibility issues often - and prioritise fixing them
- keep your accessibility statement up to date

## Understand accessibility law

Accessibility is everyone’s responsibility. CQC is breaking the law if we design services which are not accessible.

You must demonstrate how you are complying with accessibility law as part of your service assessments.

### Your service must
- meet level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1), as a minimum
- work on the most common assistive technologies
- include disabled people in user research
- publish an accessibility statement (from private beta)
- arrange an accessibility audit (before public beta)
