# Design for whole services

## Make design decisions in a joined up, consistent way, from start to finish.

Work towards creating a service that meets users’ needs across all channels, including online, phone, paper and face to face.

Our services must work for users with no previous knowledge of the task they need to do. Designing, building and running services in this way makes it easier for us to meet policy and regulation requirements.

> “To a user, a service is one continuous set of actions towards the end goal, regardless of who is providing it.”<br>_Lou Downe, The School of Good Services_


### Is your service good?

A good service meets the [15 principles of good service design (The School of Good Services)](https://good.services/15-principles-of-good-service-design).

Benchmark your service before, during and after delivery. 

1. Clearly explain the purpose
2. Set a user’s expectations of the service
3. Enable each user to complete the outcome they set out to do
4. Work in a way that is familiar
5. Require no prior knowledge to use
6. Be agnostic of organisational structures
7. Require the minimum possible steps to complete
8. Be consistent throughout
9. Have no dead ends
10. Be usable by everyone, equally
11. Encourage the right behaviours from users and service providers
12. Quickly respond to change
13. Clearly explain why a decision has been made
14. Make it easy to get human assistance

### Good practice
You should:
- know what your users are trying to achieve
- define the steps and actions users must take to achieve their goals
- consider the end-to-end experience - both front and back-stage
- understand the history and intended evolution of the service to help you design for today and tomorrow
