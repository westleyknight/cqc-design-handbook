# Build on existing services and evidence

## Reuse what we already know works from testing with people. Share your team's work, documenting your evidence and design patterns.

If we've solved a problem before, reuse the solution. Don’t spend time reinventing the wheel if you don’t need to.

Be accountable and have confidence in your solutions. As you solve new problems, add the solutions to our pattern and component libraries. Celebrate new wins across teams.

### Why this matters

Reusing what already works frees up your team’s time to focus on the unique problems in your service. It also makes our services consistent, so they’re easier to use.

### Good practice
You should:
- reuse design patterns and code where appropriate 
- avoid bespoke solutions to common problems
- make sure systems look and behave the same
- document design decisions using a shared design log
