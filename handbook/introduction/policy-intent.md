# Working from policy intent and meeting user needs  

There are legal requirements for people to interact with CQC so that we can respond and determine an appropriate next set of actions.
Policy sets the boundaries of what needs to happen through the delivery of our regulated services. 

{: .note }
> “Design of regulated services means creating optimal user experiences and interactions that support policy outcomes.”

By ‘user experience’ we mean meeting the needs of our users. This covers anyone who interacts with CQC, or who has to act on information provided to CQC.
