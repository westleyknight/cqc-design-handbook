# The purpose of user centred design at CQC

## Our CQC purpose
To ensure health and care services provide people with safe, effective, compassionate high-quality care and to encourage those service to improve.

## User centred design is how we ensure: 
- our systems, processes and interactions work effectively for our users
- we use data and build technology-enabled solutions in an effective and efficient way, reducing friction, unnecessary steps, and the time it takes to carry out tasks
- risk is managed through user research and engagement, increasing our confidence in new solutions and business change being prioritised
