# How we understand our services

We describe our services using verbs.
This helps us to understand what needs to happen, or what someone is doing, when they interact with CQC.
Describing services this way works for our internal functions and processes at CQC, as well as how providers and citizens interact with us externally .

{: .note }
> “A service is something that helps someone to do something.”

For example:
- Learn to drive
- Buy a house
- Become a foster parent
- Renew my passport 
- Give feedback on a social care provider
