# An introduction to user centred design at CQC
{: .note }
‘User centred design’ is designing with a focus on the people who use our services. It means we prioritise users’ needs, usability and accessibility in every design decision.


## Our users
A ‘user’ is someone who interacts with one or more of our services. Users can be internal or external. Our broad user groups are:

### Providers
The people and organisations that deliver care.

### Citizens
The people that benefit from the care that providers deliver.

### Internal teams
The people that make our services work, including those who work with and act upon data.
