# Agile project management

At CQC we run every phase of user centred design work in an ‘agile’ way. 

Agile is a method to deliver projects, known for its flexibility and adaptability. 

It determines each team’s rhythm and ways of working. It also has a positive impact on a team’s culture, creating an environment of trust and transparency.

Agile teams work in a ‘multidisciplinary’ way. This means they have a diverse mix of skills and expertise.

The following slides explain the different roles and responsibilities in an agile multidisciplinary team.

## Key rhythms and rituals
Agile rhythms and rituals help optimise a team. They ensure that we do work at a sustainable pace, and that there is constant feedback loops for transparency and openness.

Agile projects are planned and delivered in ‘sprints’. This is a regular, repeatable, time-boxed period in which work is completed. 

Each sprint will usually be 2 weeks in length and made up of the following: 
- sprint planning
- ‘standups’ - regular team check ins
- work on prioritised tasks
- a show and tell of progress to wider stakeholders
- a retrospective - space for team reflection together

## Working in the open
Working in the open ensures that everyone in CQC can connect and collaborate outside of their immediate teams. 

Our ways of working have been designed to support teams to work transparently and to be accountable for the outcomes they deliver.

Working in the open includes documenting design decision, design patterns, and work from user research to share more widely within CQC.

Teams can also consider publishing weeknotes, or email updates to keep stakeholders and the wider business informed about their work.
