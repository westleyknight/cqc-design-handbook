# Discovery and alpha work

We follow an agreed user centred design methodology. This is always a combination of discovery and alpha work. 

We do discovery and alpha work before we finalise technical specifications for build and business change priorities. Itâ€™s how we make sure we build the right solution in the right way.

The next slide shows where discovery and alpha work sits with our full service delivery lifecycle.

## Discovery work

In discovery we learn about:
- user needs
- business processes
- policy context

We understand the stories and experiences of providers, citizens and internal teams.

Our research helps us focus on what needs to happen in order to solve user problems. We spend time thinking about how best to design interactions and experiences within the context of our regulatory services. 


## Alpha work

In alpha we explore solutions and different ways of solving problems.

We consider ways of designing user journeys and business processes, continuously testing and engaging with internal and external users throughout.

The focus here is building organisational confidence in whether future solutions will deliver intended outcomes. Alpha work should focus on testing assumptions, looking at edge cases and where proposed solutions and ideas may break when they come into contact with real world scenarios.
