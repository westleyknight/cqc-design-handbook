# Project delivery models for user centred design

We use a flexible model for applying discovery and alpha work. This is based on the estimated size and complexity of services, parts of services, key functionality, or feature development. 

This can be adapted from a rapid 2-week design sprint, to an 8 to 12 week sprint.

## Example: 2-week rapid design sprint

### Day 1 - Understanding and framing the problem
Framing a predefined problem statement and assumptions to test.

Desk research and gathering of insights and data.

### Day 2 - Prioritising opportunities
Prioritising opportunity areas to focus on.

Alignment with service vision and CQC design principles.

### Day 3 - Design and ideation
Ideation sessions to explore different ideas, approaches, solutions, and future service states or changes.

### Days 4 to 5 - Building a prototype
Developing a testable prototype using different materials and 
approaches.

Design in code if appropriate.

### Days 6 to 10 - Testing iteration and evaluation
Testing, evaluating and iterating the prototype.

Capturing and sharing knowledge and insights.

This 2-week rapid design sprint approach combines discovery and alpha work. 
It would be most suited to evaluating known problems, and where gap analysis has identified areas of the build or existing features and 
solutions to revisit. 
This approach would also be suited for fast exploration around the viability of new features where research already exists to support our understanding of user needs and scenarios. 

_Note: team shapes and roles for these specific examples are included later in the handbook._

## Example: 12 week agile sprint model

### Sprint 1 (2 weeks) - Framing the problem and data gathering
Framing problem statements.
Understanding any existing data and 
knowledge in this problem space or service area.
Planning and recruitment for user research to understand service, outcomes, user needs and scenarios.

### Sprint 2 to 3 (4 weeks) - User research, synthesis and prioritisation 
User research activities.
User research synthesis with actions agreed.
Prioritisation where to focus time and effort, such as opportunity areas to focus on.
Capture service maps and journeys.
Alignment with service vision and design principles.

### Sprint 4 to 5 (4 weeks) - Design, ideation, prototyping and iteration
Ideation sessions exploring different ideas, approaches, solutions and future service states.
Building prototypes to test with different users, and iterating based on feedback.
Identifying and working with design patterns.
Understanding dependencies with other services. 

### Sprint 6 (2 weeks) - Further evaluation and technical scope
Testing and evaluating detailed content, user interface (UI) design, including accessibility testing. 
High level data and tech discovery to plan for final requirements.
Recommendations along with detailed service blueprint and packaged work – for example, prototypes and artefacts

### With business design and technology teams - Next steps and moving into build
Technology requirement agreed and captured.
Business design dependencies mapped with signed off 
‘service proposition’.

This longer sprint model would be suitable for work where we need to learn more about user needs, policy context and scenarios in order to design the right solutions before specifications are agreed for build.
