# Design assurance

We plan to use light touch assessment processes established through an ‘alpha assessment’ point that must be passed in order for work of an agreed size or complexity must pass to move to final requirements and build and production work.

Service Directors will be responsible for managing work in their portfolio through this process. 

All our teams will be coached and supported working to agreed service methods and standards through investment in lead roles for disciplines and communities of practice.

_Note: the full process for how to book, and undertake a service assessment at CQC is still under review. Full details will be provided directly to service teams when available._
